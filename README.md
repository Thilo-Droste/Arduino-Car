# Arduino-Car
This repository is about a selfdriving Arduino-Car.  
"includes.h" defines my variables.  
"Try 4" is about my first finished and working projekt. It is based on an simple if-condition system.
As you can see in the "try4" video, the ultrasonic sensor is still having trouble detecting sloping walls. For this reason "try5" added the moving of the sensor while driving.  
"Try 5" is my second finished working projekt. It's based on the abstract machine system.
