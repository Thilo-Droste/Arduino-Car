# Arduino-Car
This repository is about an selfdriving Arduino-Car.  
"includes.h" defines my variables.  
"Try 4" is about my first finished an working projekt. It is based on an simple if system.
As you can see in the "try4" video, the ultrasonic sensor is still having difficulty detecting sloping walls. For this reason "try5" added moving the sensor while driving.  
"Try 5" is my second  finished an working projekt.It is based on the Abstract machine system.
